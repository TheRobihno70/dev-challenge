# DBF Development Challenge - Checklist

- [ ] Clone this repository. All of your work will need to be committed to your local copy.
- [ ] Initialize a new React app in the `app/` folder (use `create-react-app`).
- [ ] Implement the user stories we provide.
  - User stories with high priority are required, while all others are left as a bonus.
  - Commit regularly and ensure that you create commits with a sensible message. This allows you to show us how you work and solve problems.
  - Solutions without a history (i.e., with all changes in few commits) will be regarded as lower quality.
- [ ] Respond to three questions from the set of questions we provide. Store and commit your responses in `QUESTIONS.md`.
- [ ] Create a Github repository and push the finalized challenge. Share the repository with us when you apply (either by public link, or by adding `rschlaefli` and `mkllr888`).
