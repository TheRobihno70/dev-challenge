# DBF Developer Challenge - Overview

This repository contains a coding challenge used for the application process of web developers at the Department of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich. We think that it is fairer and more realistic to judge the capabilities of applicants with a small task, rather than asking questions about technical topics.

If you seek more information about us and what we work on at the DBF, check <https://uzh-bf.github.io/joinus/>!

## Application process

When you apply for a job at our department, this will be the process:
1. Solve challenge part 1: Create a small React app to show your technical abilities :robot:
2. Solve challenge part 1: Answer 3 out of 5 questions to prove your knowledge :pencil2:
3. Send us the the results (of both parts) for a quick evaluation :outbox_tray:
4. Everybody that successfully completes the challenge gets invited to a job interview :bell:
5. If we feel like you fit in our team, we will hire you! :checkered_flag::moneybag:
