# Challenge Part 1: Web Development with React

For the first part of the challenge you will create a React App based on [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). The application should be based on the user stories defined below. It must implement all required user stories as well as one user story from the additional section.

## Requirements, Constraints, and Ideas

Your application must satisfy the following basic constraints:

- :exclamation: It must be based on `React` and initialized with `create-react-app`.
- :exclamation: It must apply the `lourenci/react-kanban` library for logic related to Kanban interactions. We recommend using the `uncontrolled` version of the board to save you a lot of boilerplate (and time).
- :exclamation: It must satisfy the acceptance criteria of all high-priority user stories, plus one additional user story of your choosing. Any further work is optional, but we encourage you to invest some time into styling the application.
- :bulb: Besides these basic requirements, you may use any libraries or tools you like. For example, you could apply libraries and frameworks like `Semantic UI` or `Material UI` to help with styling.
